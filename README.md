# Route Optimizer using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

This project is a route optimization system that computes the shortest path between locations using **Dijkstra’s algorithm** on a weighted graph.

It also supports:
- **Multiple intermediate stops**
- **Dynamic edge weights** based on weather conditions

---

## 🚀 Features
- Shortest path computation using Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Custom Min Heap (Priority Queue) implementation
- Multi-stop route optimization (source → stops → destination)
- Weather-based cost adjustment (clear, rain, storm)
- REST API built with Express
- Simple React frontend for testing

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- Time Complexity: `O(E log V)` using Min Heap
- Graph represented as an adjacency list

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Frontend:** React
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra, Min Heap
- **Data:** JSON-based graph
